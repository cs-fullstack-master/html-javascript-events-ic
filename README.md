# HTML front end JavaScript events IC

### Exercise 1:
Create an HTML file with a button. Using JavaScript, each time a button is clicked use the array below to change the color of the ```Body``` background to the corresponding index. The colors do not have to start over once the last color is reached.

``` ["blue", "red", "yellow", "brown", "orange", "purple", "black", "green"]  ```

##### Challenge:
Make the colors recycle once the last color is reached.

### Exercise 2:
Create an HTML page containing 3 different buttons, one saying ```RED```, one saying ```GREEN```, and one saying ```BLUE```.
When the User holds the mouse over one of the buttons, change the background color according to the text value on the button.

##### Challenge:
* Add header text that states the current Color (e.g. `The current Color is SELECTEDCOLOR` with the name of the current color in place of `SELECTEDCOLOR`
